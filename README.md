Software used for this project:
1) Raspberry Pi OS Lite, a port of Debian Trixie with no desktop environment (https://www.raspberrypi.com)
3) FFMPEG, UFW, SSH, RFKILL, LSHW, WPASUPPLICANT, RESOLVCONF, and some custom Bash Scripts.

I used a Raspberry Pi due to its low consumption but you can set it up on any Debian-compatible system.
